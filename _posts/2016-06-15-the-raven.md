  Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a
  quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- While I nodded, nearly napping,
  suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my
  chamber door. "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door-
  Only this and nothing more."
